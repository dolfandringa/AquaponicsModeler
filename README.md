# AquaponicsModeler
AquaponicsModeler allows you to model and visualize water flow in aquaponics
systems with different components. It produces nice plots that can be saved for
future reference, and allows you to compare different models.

The application has been written in python using PyQt5 and matplotlib for the
interface and plots.
